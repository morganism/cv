```
Ruby is my preferred language although I am competent in several programming
languages, such as Java, Perl, C, sh, Expect and Python. I always exhibit a very thorough
approach to work with a great attention to detail, testing, peer review and
documentation. I develop on Macs and Linux machines and have been using linux since
1996.

I am experienced in the Agile SDLC where an iterative approach to development, testing
and requirements gathering results in many small changes rather than monolithic changes
that are difficult to debug and analyse when issues occur.

I have experience leading teams within a matrix management environment and I work well
within and leading Agile teams. I have strong technical skills that augment my design
ability which leads to practical and deliverable solutions. In 1995 I created the first online
university course catalogue at UCLA leading to an invitation from Pete Wilson, the
governor of California, to provide subject matter expertise and assistance in setting up the
foundations of the California Virtual University. I have made contributions to the java
language (NFSFile) and have worked in web and software development since 1994, as well
as diverse technological disciplines such as streaming media, IoT, and LiveOps mobile
game development.

I regularly write publicly available, open source software which is available on [GitHub - http://git.morganism.dev/](http://git.morganism.dev/) The README.md will indicate fitness for purpose.

I am a father and a husband; as a family we love to travel. I have been a coach for the
Southwark Tigers RFC, and really enjoy rugby. I have a passion for open source software
and the ‘open’ model whose influence is noticeable across industries. I am a biochemist,
scientist and skeptic. I love to cook and explore cuisine. RaspberryPi and SmartHome
device integration are just a couple of my spare time coding projects.

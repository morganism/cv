**The Hiring Manager**  
Okta

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Site Reliability/Platform Engineering role you’ve advertised. With over a decade of experience deploying and maintaining high-availability systems across diverse industries—including fintech, gaming, and IoT, I bring the expertise needed to help replatform and scale mission-critical services with zero downtime.

At Zilch, I was instrumental in managing AWS infrastructure that underpins financial services used by thousands daily. Observability, metrics and alerting were key components in ensuring customer satisfaction. 

At Supermassive Games, I led the transition AAA game pipelines into a cloud-native LiveOps model, leveraging Fastly, GitOps, and Thundernetes to transform legacy build processes into automated, scalable services and containerised game servers.

At Centrica Hive, I led the SRE/DevOps function for our SmartHome platform, introducing Kafka-based messaging, building GitHub-based CI/CD pipelines, and designing monitoring strategies with Kibana, Grafana and ElasticSearch. Across all roles, I have been a tireless advocate for system resiliency, cost efficiency, and secure, observable infrastructure.

Your role’s emphasis on mentoring, zero-downtime migrations, and container orchestration aligns perfectly with my career arc. I thrive in fast-paced environments where systems evolve, services scale, and teams push the envelope of what’s possible in cloud operations. Whether automating away toil with Python or evolving SDLC patterns, I bring battle-tested skills and a collaborative spirit.

I would be thrilled to discuss how I can contribute to your team’s success. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,  
**Morgan Sziraki**
